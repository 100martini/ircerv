Project Status: ~90% Complete


Completed Features:

HTTP Methods: GET, POST, DELETE fully functional

CGI Execution: Working with Python and PHP support

File Uploads: Multipart form-data parsing implemented

Configuration File: Complete parser with validation

Non-blocking I/O: Epoll implementation for all operations

Error Handling: Proper HTTP status codes and custom error pages

Static File Serving: Full MIME type support

Directory Listing: Autoindex functionality

Redirections: 3xx status codes with location headers

Client Body Size Limits: Per-location and server-wide

Keep-Alive Connections: HTTP/1.1 persistent connections


Remaining Tasks:
1. Stress Testing (CRITICAL)
 Test with 100+ concurrent connections
 Ensure server remains stable under load
 Test with siege or ab (Apache Bench)
 Memory leak check with valgrind

2. Chunked Transfer Encoding
 Handle Transfer-Encoding: chunked header
 Implement chunked request body parsing
 Required for CGI as per subject PDF

3. CGI Robustness
 Test PHP CGI thoroughly
 Test with POST data and file uploads via CGI
 Add timeout handling for hanging CGI scripts
 Test CGI environment variables completeness

4. Final Testing
 Multiple server blocks on different ports
 Large file uploads (100MB+)
 Keep-alive connection reuse
 Edge cases (malformed requests, partial sends)
